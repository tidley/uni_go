## Background

Case study of WeChat's ecosystem and how to implement using decentralised technologies in Rust.

## Aim

- Research the components in WeChat (messaging, payments, blogging, meeting)
- develop app which interacts with tech that offers sufficient performance. E.g. messaging that must deliver messages whilst you were offline, so check past events when eventually going online and use events as notifier of new messages in real-time. Sender must therefore pay tx fee.

## Tasks

1. Develop phone app in Rust to interact with polygon
